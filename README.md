📘 Student Feedback Analysis: Data-Driven Event Insights

This project focuses on analyzing student feedback collected from various college activities such as workshops, seminars, and technical/cultural events.
The goal is to convert raw survey data (numeric ratings) into clear insights using Python to help improve future events.

🔑 Key Tasks Performed

**Data Cleaning:** Removed unnecessary columns, handled missing values, clipped rating values to a valid 1–10 range.

**Statistical Exploration:** Calculated mean, standard deviation, and overall distribution for all rating questions.

**Visual Analysis:** Created easy-to-interpret charts like bar plots, histograms, boxplots, and a heatmap.

**Insight Extraction:** Identified strengths and areas needing improvement based on rating patterns.
